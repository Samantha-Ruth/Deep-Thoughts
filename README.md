# Deep-Thoughts

## Description

The goal of this project was to utilize the MERN stack to create social media app where individual could share their thoughts, reply to other's thoughts, and add friends.

In this project, I learned how to: 

* Use GraphQL and to integrate Apollo Server GraphQL libary to handle data requests
* How to use Apollo Studio Explorer interface to test GraphQL queries.
* How to build both query type definitions and resolvers for retrieving data from a MongoDB database
* How to use GraphQL mutations to handle updates to said database.

* How to use Apollo Client library to consume GraphQL APIs on the front end
* How to manually read and write to the Apollo Client Cache

* How to use JSON Web Tokens as part of the authentication process

* How to use the React Router (Routes and Route Components) to set up client-side routing
* Implement login functionality and user-based navigation in React. 

* Learned how to use an npm packaged called concurrently to run both React and GraphQL from the same command line during development.

* Configure a MERN app to deploy to Heroku.
