# Deep-Thoughts

## Description

The goal of this project was to utilize the MERN stack to create social media app where individual could share their thoughts, reply to other's thoughts, and add friends.

In this project, I learned how to: 

Maunally read and write to the Apollo Client Cache
Configure a MERN app to deploy to Heroku.
Integrate Apollo Server GraphQL libary to handle data requests
Build both query type definitions and resolvers for retrieiving data from a MongoDB databse
Use Apollo Studio Explorer interfact to test GraphQL queriies
Use GraphQL mutations to handle updates to a databse.
Sign and verify JSON WEb Tokens as part of the authentication process
Use Apollo Client library to consume GraphQL APIs on the front end
Use Routes and Route components to set up client-side routing
Implement login funtionality and user=based navication in React. 
Learned how to use an npm packaged called concurrently to run both React and GraphQL from the same command line.
